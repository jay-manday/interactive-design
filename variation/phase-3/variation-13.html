        And some time this I will dream again,
      </h3>

      <h3 id="centered">
        And all will be repeated, all be re-embodied,
      </h3>

      <h3 id="centered">
        You will dream everything I have seen in dream.
      </h3>

      <h3 id="centered">
        To one side from ourselves, to one side from the world
      </h3>

        Wave follows wave to break on the shore,
      </h3>
      <h3 id="centered">

        On each wave is a star, a person, a bird,
      </h3>

      <h3 id="centered">
        Dreams, reality, death - on wave after wave.
      </h3>

      <h3 id="centered">
        No need for a date: I was, I am, and I will be,
      </h3>

      <h3 id="centered">
        Life is a wonder of wonders, and to wonder
      </h3>
      <h3 id="centered">
        I dedicate myself, on my knees, like an orphan,
      </h3>
      <h3 id="centered">
        Alone - among mirrors - fenced in by reflections:
      </h3>
      <h3 id="centered">
        Cities and seas, iridescent, intensified.
      </h3>
      <h3 id="centered">
        A mother in tears takes a child on her lap.
